# AES
An inplementation of AES 128 Bits Encryption based on Python.

**Some Notes*** :

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data later on.

**How to let it work:** :
juste execute the main file aes.python by setting two params(textToCipher, theKey), for example:

```
python aes.py "My Plain Text" "Secret Key"
```
